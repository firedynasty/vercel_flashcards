Summary of Changes - January 28, 2026

1. Fix save to use flashcard content instead of textarea (commit 3b4c054)
   - Added getContentToSave() function that reconstructs content from loaded flashcards
   - Save button now saves the actual flashcard data based on current parse mode:
     * "line-memorize" mode: saves each card as a separate line
     * "Front → Back" mode: saves as pairs separated by blank lines
   - Textarea is updated after save to show what was saved

2. Simplify flashcard parsing to work with any language (commit 720f773)
   - Removed Chinese character detection from parsing logic
   - Now uses simple line position:
     * First line = front of card
     * Second line = back of card
     * Single line = back is empty string
   - Works for any language: Chinese, Spanish, English, etc.

Result: Save and load now work together properly - what you save is what you get when you load.

3. Save parse mode with file content (commit 8ff7506)
   - Files now saved as JSON: {"mode": "...", "content": "..."}
   - When loading, parse mode dropdown is automatically set to saved mode
   - Backward compatible with plain text files
